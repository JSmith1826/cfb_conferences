    "Further membership changes saw the league expand to its maximum of 16 members. From 1997 through 2006, the league also operated a football conference; during that period, more than 20 schools were participating in A-10 competition in at least one sport. This ended when the A-10 football programs all departed to join a new football conference sponsored by the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA; now known as the Coastal Athletic Association). In 2012, Butler joined the conference after leaving the Horizon League and VCU joined after leaving the CAA.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Former football-only members -->\n",
    "After expansion in the Colonial Athletic Association brought that conference to 6 football-playing schools, it was agreed that the CAA would take over management of the Atlantic 10's football conference starting in the 2007–08 school year as the legally separate entity of CAA Football. All the schools on this list (except Boston U. and Connecticut) were in the A-10 football conference when it became CAA Football, but Hofstra and Northeastern discontinued their football programs after the 2009–10 school year. Membership dates include time in the Yankee Conference (which was an all-sports conference from the 1947–48 to 1975–76 seasons, and a football-only conference after that) which merged into the A-10 in the 1997–98 school year."

    "# Colonial  / Coastal Conference Athletic Association\n",
    "\n",
    "The Coastal Athletic Association Football Conference, formerly the Colonial Athletic Association Football Conference, branded as CAA Football, is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA's Division I whose full members are located in East Coast states, from Maine to North Carolina. Most of its members are public universities, and the conference is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. The conference is run by the same administration as the multisport conference Coastal Athletic Association (CAA; formerly the Colonial Athletic Association) but is legally a different entity.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "CAA Football was formed in 2005, although it did not begin play until 2007, as a separate conference independent of the CAA, but administered by the CAA front office. In the 2004–05 academic year, the CAA had five member schools that sponsored football, all of them as football-only members of the Atlantic 10 Conference. In 2005, Northeastern accepted the CAA's offer of membership, giving the CAA the six football-playing members it needed under NCAA rules to organize a football conference. At that time, the CAA announced it would launch its new football conference in 2007. Next, the CAA invited the University of Richmond to become a football-only member effective in 2007. Once UR accepted the offer, this left the A10 football conference with only five members, less than the six required under NCAA rules. As a result, the remaining A10 football programs all decided to join the CAA for football only, ending A10 football. Since the CAA football conference had the same members as the A10 the previous year, it can be said that the CAA football conference is the A10 football conference under new management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAA football conference's earliest roots are in the New England Conference, founded in 1938 by four state-supported universities in that region plus Northeastern; three of the public schools are currently in CAA Football. However, neither the multi-sports CAA nor CAA Football includes the New England Conference in CAA Football history.[2] After the departure of Northeastern in 1945, the remaining members joined New England's other land-grant colleges, Massachusetts State College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst) and the University of Vermont, to form the Yankee Conference under a new charter in 1946, with competition starting in 1947. That conference eventually dropped all sports other than football in 1975. Starting in the 1980s, it expanded to include many schools outside its original New England base. After the NCAA voted to limit the influence of single-sport conferences, the Yankee merged with the A-10 in 1997.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also: 2010–2013 Colonial Athletic Association realignment\n",
    "CAA Football went through many changes during the early 2010s with the loss of Georgia State, Massachusetts, and Old Dominion and the addition of Albany, Elon, and Stony Brook. Stability was maintained for a decade before the departure of James Madison in 2021 leading to the addition of Campbell, Hampton, Monmouth, North Carolina A&T, and Bryant from 2022 to 2024."

    "The Gulf Coast Conference (GCC) was a short-lived NCAA college athletic conference composed of universities in the U.S. state of Texas from 1949 until 1957. The charter members of the conference were University of Houston, Midwestern University (now Midwestern State University), North Texas State College (now the University of North Texas), and Trinity University.[1] The Gulf Coast Conference spawned from then members of the Lone Star Conference, and its president was D.L. Ligon.[2] In 1956, when the NCAA created divisions, all members of the conference at the time were classified as part of the NCAA's College Division, which was later subdivided into Division II and Division III in 1973. Charter member Houston had already left for the Missouri Valley Conference by the end of 1950, and was classified as a University Division school, which later became known as Division I."

Initial officers included W. H. Bliss of Indiana (president), R. D. Meeker of Butler (vice president), and A. H. Bradshaw of Franklin (secretary).[1] The IIAA existed at a time of transition for intercollegiate athletics. When it was created, college sports were only loosely controlled by the institutions they represented; most schools followed the Yale model, in which programs were run by a combination of students, alumni, and boosters. By the time of its dissolution, most larger schools (and an increasing number of smaller ones) had adopted the Chicago model, featuring an athletic director and multi-sport coach who was a full-time employee of the institution, on the model of Amos Alonzo Stagg, whom the University of Chicago had hired for such a role in 1892. Nevertheless, as late as 1903-4, the IIAA was still a student-run organization. That year, C. L. Peck, \"an Indianapolis student at Purdue,\" was elected IIAA president at the association's annual December meeting.[2]"

Founded as the Association of Mid-Continent Universities in 1982,[1] it rebranded as the Mid-Continent Conference in 1989,[3] then again as the Summit League on June 1, 2007.[4] The league headquarters are in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n",
    "\n",
    "The membership currently consists of 9 full members plus 7 associate members. The most recent change in the core conference membership is the 2021 arrival of the University of St. Thomas, which began an unprecedented transition from NCAA Division III to Division I.[5] A year earlier, the University of Missouri–Kansas City returned as a full member after a seven-year absence with the new athletic identity of the Kansas City Roos,[6] while Purdue University Fort Wayne left for the Horizon League.[7] A total of 32 schools have been full members; the last charter member remaining in the league, Western Illinois University, left for the Ohio Valley Conference on July 1, 2023, though it will remain in the Summit men's soccer league through the fall 2023 season.[8]\n",

    "The conference can trace its roots back to 1978, when the Mid-Continent Athletic Association was founded as a football-only conference playing in Division II at the time.[9] Its inaugural members were the University of Akron, Eastern Illinois University, University of Northern Iowa, Northern Michigan University, Western Illinois University, and Youngstown State University; Wayne State University had also expressed interest in joining, but ultimately never did.[10] Akron left after the 1979 season, while Northern Michigan and Youngstown State left the following year; they were replaced by Southwest Missouri State (now known as Missouri State University) in 1981. The 1981 season also saw the conference as a whole move from Division II to Division I-AA; this would be the conference's final season under the name of the Mid-Continent Athletic Association."

One exception was Gallaudet, which is located in Washington, D.C. All of the members were universities, except Baltimore City College, a preparatory school located in Baltimore, Maryland.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impetus for the formation of the MIFA was a controversial game on November 1, 1893 between the Maryland Agricultural College (now known as the University of Maryland, College Park) and Saint John's College of Annapolis. Maryland won the game, 6–0, but St. John's players later wrote in the Baltimore American that \"a decision by which the M.A.C. were allowed to score the only touchdown made by the quarterback after a run of 90 yards, with no one in pursuit, appeared a very doubtful one.\"[1] Maryland finished the season by beating Western Maryland and the Orient Athletic Club. With a 6–0 record, the \"Aggies\" were named the state champions, but the title was contested by St. John's. The following season, Maryland's former quarterback and coach William W. Skinner led the effort to create an intercollegiate football league to improve the process in which the state championship was awarded.[2] The conference began competition on October 13, 1894 with games between St. John's College and Washington College in Annapolis, and Maryland Agricultural College and Western Maryland in Westminster.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The association voted to disband during the 1899 season under the threat of withdrawal by Johns Hopkins University after legislation was passed to prevent its use of graduate student-athletes. The league was subsequently reorganized without Hopkins. Maryland Agricultural College claimed the championship in 1906. After the 1907 season, the Aggies, St. John's and Washington reformed the association, without Western Maryland College, with the S.J.C. Cadets retaining their title of the three-team \"league\" in 1908.\n"

    "The Ohio Valley Conference can trace its roots to 1941 when Murray State athletic director Roy Stewart, Eastern Kentucky athletic director Charles \"Turkey\" Hughes, and Western Kentucky public relations director Kelly Thompson first formulated the idea of establishing a regional athletics conference. The plan was put on hold due to World War II, but it was resurrected after the conclusion of the war. In 1948, the three schools joined with Louisville, Morehead State, and Evansville to form the Ohio Valley Conference. While many collegiate conferences are struggling today with the question of whether their policies and rules should be determined by the athletic departments or by the institutional heads, from the very beginning, the OVC has been run by the presidents of its member schools."

    "\n",
    "The Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association (TIAA) was a college sports association that operated from 1909 to 1932. All of its members were located in the US state of Texas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### History\n",
    "Founded in 1909 by Southwestern University, Austin College, Texas Christian University, Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor University and Trinity University the TIAA had a changing set of members that spun off into the Southwest Conference, Lone Star Conference and the Texas Conference. The league had been formed to rid college athletics of objectionable elements like gambling and place them entirely under the control of the schools. At first the league worked well, but soon the disparity in the sizes of the schools became an issue. The large state schools, with bigger stadiums and crowds, began to refuse to travel to the smaller schools and insisted on playing that at home.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This battle between the large and small schools led to the first big change in 1914, when Texas, A&M, Baylor and Southwestern left to form the Southwest Conference, with some considering themselves to be members of both. After two seasons, Southwestern left the Southwest conference and returned to the TIAA. The conferences became completely separate in 1917. In 1922, TIAA expanded by including North Texas.[2] In 1923, TCU left to join the Southwest Conference and in 1924, Rice followed suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1925, the TIAA was split between members who wanted to allow freshmen and transfers to play and schools that did not. This fault line also separated the teachers colleges that had joined over the years and the church-sponsored schools that had been founders. In May 1925, those that wanted to allow them to play—Trinity, Simmons University (now Hardin–Simmons University), Austin College, Howard Payne, and Southwestern—left to form the Texas Conference, but they agreed to play out the fall 1925 football season within the TIAA. Play within the Texas Conference began with the 1926 basketball season. The five departing schools were all church supported and agreed to ally themselves \"along denominational lines.\"[2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "By 1930, the TIAA had expanded back to 11 members. This included teachers colleges such as Sul Ross, West Texas, East Texas, North Texas, Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin, and Southwest Texas as well as Abilene Christian College, Daniel Baker, Texas A&I and McMurry. But in May 1931, five TIAA schools joined together to form the Lone Star Conference. These were Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin, East Texas, Southwest Texas and North Texas.[4][2] As a result, the conference was dissolved in 1932. Many of the members became independents and eventually wound up in the short-lived Alamo Conference."

    "### History\n",
    "The VSAC was organized in the 1940s and dissolved in the early 1980s. Member schools were in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Long-term members of the conference included the institutions now known as Belmont University, Bethel University, Bryan College, Carson–Newman University, Christian Brothers University, King University, Lee University, Lincoln Memorial University, Lipscomb University, Milligan College, Tusculum University, Tennessee Wesleyan University, and Union University, as well as the now-defunct Lambuth University.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dissolution\n",
    "The conference dissolved when the institutions in the eastern portion of the state seceded to form the Tennessee Valley Athletic Conference (TVAC). Those in the western part of the state formed in turn the Tennessee Collegiate Athletic Conference (TCAC). The Appalachian Athletic Conference is the direct successor of the TVAC, and was known as such until the mid-1990s when the addition of schools in Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina necessitated the name change. The TranSouth Athletic Conference, which operated from 1996 to 2013, is sometimes regarded as something of a successor to the TCAC. Sponsorship of football by the conference ended after the 1962 season, over two decades before the conference dissolved with regard to its other sports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other founding members of the VSAC included East Tennessee State University, Middle Tennessee State University, Austin Peay State University, and Tennessee Technological University; these schools all left the VSAC to join the Ohio Valley Conference. As of 2019, Austin Peay and Tennessee Tech remain in the OVC, while East Tennessee State is in the Southern Conference and Middle Tennessee in Conference USA."

    "# Western Interstate University Football Association\n",
    "\n",
    "The Western Interstate University Football Association (WIUFA) was one of the first intercollegiate athletic conferences in the United States,[1] existing from 1892 to 1897.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formation, history and evolution\n",
    "The football teams from the Universities of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska formed the conference and competed against each other annually. Early WIUFA play led to the transition of the famous rivalry between Kansas and Missouri to the football field as many of the fans and some of the first players on both teams were the sons of men who had fought each other on either side of the conflict in Bleeding Kansas and later the Civil War. Racial tension surrounding the participation of Iowa's Frank Kinney Holbrook in the 1896 game between Iowa and Missouri ended up preventing what may have become a long-standing rivalry between the two schools.[2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "All four members of the WIUFA would later be among the original members of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA), which was formed in 1907. Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska stayed with the MVIAA as it evolved over the decades into the Big Eight Conference, which existed through the 1995 season, while Iowa remained a member of the Big Ten Conference and left after only one season of MVIAA competition. Beginning in 1996, the members of the Big Eight joined with four schools of the former Southwest Conference to form the new Big 12 Conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Record-keeping discrepancies\n",
    "For every year of the conference's existence, except 1896, there was at least one disagreement as to the final score of a game between member schools. However, in no cases is the final outcome of any game disputed.[4]"

    "\n",
    "The West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) was a collegiate athletic conference which historically operated exclusively in the state of West Virginia, but briefly had one Kentucky member in its early years, and expanded into Pennsylvania in its final years. It participated in the Division II ranks of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), originally affiliated in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) until 1994, but held its final athletic competitions in spring 2013, and officially disbanded on September 1 of that year. Its football-playing members announced in June 2012 that they planned to withdraw to form a new Division II conference at the end of the 2012–13 season; this led to a chain of conference moves that saw all but one of the WVIAC's members find new conference homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "History\n",
    "The conference was rated as one of the oldest in intercollegiate athletics, dating back to its founding in 1924 by the West Virginia Department of Education.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its final school year of 2012–13, the WVIAC offered championships in 16 sports and was headquartered in Princeton, West Virginia. Men's championships were offered in football, basketball, baseball, track, cross country, soccer, tennis, and golf. Women's titles were contested in volleyball, softball, basketball, cross country, soccer, track, tennis, and golf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WVIAC moved into the NCAA Division II in 1994 after its long affiliation with the NAIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its post-season basketball tournament, which was first conducted in 1936, was at the time of the conference's demise one of the oldest college post-season tournaments in continuous existence—only the Southern Conference men's basketball tournament, established in 1922, was older."

    "The Yankee Conference was a collegiate sports conference in the eastern United States. From 1947 to 1976, it sponsored competition in many sports, but was a football-only league from mid-1976 until its dissolution in 1996. It is essentially the ancestor of today's CAA Football, the legally separate football league operated by the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA), and the continuation of the New England Conference, though all three leagues were founded under different charters and are considered separate conferences by the NCAA. Also, CAA Football does not recognize the New England Conference as one of its predecessors, though it does recognize the Yankee Conference as such.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first half of its history, the Yankee Conference consisted of the flagship public universities of the six New England states. Conference expansion in the 1980s and 1990s added several colleges and universities from the Mid-Atlantic region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formation\n",
    "In 1945, Northeastern University, the only private school in the New England Conference, announced its departure.[citation needed] A committee formed by the remaining four members, land-grant colleges and universities representing Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, recommended that they join with the other two New England land-grant institutions, Massachusetts State College (which had also been a founding member of the NEC in 1923, but left in the 1930s) and the University of Vermont, in a new athletics league. This led to the formation of the Yankee Conference in December 1946,[2] with athletic competition beginning in the 1947–48 school year."
