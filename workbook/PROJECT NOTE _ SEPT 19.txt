## Notes from data exploration

# Problems to check in the conference data based on observations 

- Lousiana State (LSU) Is not being assigned to the SEC corrrectly - change name in conference lookup

2018 - 2022 Sun Belt
1996 - 1998 (At Least) WAC

When filtering bowl games these 5 conference championship games are called non conference because the teams are assigned incorrect conferences. Need to correct the data
