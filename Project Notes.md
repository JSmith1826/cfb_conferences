#### Project Notes

## Scope: create a graphic map for college football like the one I did with the MHSAA stats.

Collect all available hisotrical scores from sports reference and create a visualization similar to my past project 

# Notes Sept 20

In order to diplay the schedule for each year in the tableau tooltip I could save a list of team beaten and lost to when creating the summary stats

## To Do Thursday Sept 21 -
- dig into early conferences - have a table with data scraped from wiki about all of the smaller and prot college football conferences. Parse this data to add to and correct the current confenrnce member matrix that is used to assign conference affiliation 

## Start playing around with capturing the images to make the animation. Started a ChatGPT convo to get guidance on how to do it and it suggested some helpful python libraries that should be able to automate the process of of naming/saving screenshots and cropping them.
